# EldenRingTwitchIntegration
Allows Twitch Chat to proc cheats while running Elden Ring

I've only tested this with Seamless Coop Beta 2.0, but if that mod doesn't change any memory values then this should work with base game too.

Please make sure you run this with anti-cheat disabled.

I'm not responsible if you get banned or break your game.

To run the code you will need to install Python 3.11
Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip:
python -m pip install pymem
python -m pip install twitchio
